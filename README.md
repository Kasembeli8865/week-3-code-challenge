 FLATDANGO is a movie app that allows users to view and purchase movie tickets. The app fetches movie data from a local server and displays it on the webpage. Users can see movie details such as title, poster, showtime, runtime, and the number of available tickets. They can also purchase tickets by clicking the "Buy Ticket" button.

# FEATURES

Upon opening the app in a web browser, you will see the FLATDANGO Movie App interface. The interface consists of a navigation bar, a movie list section, and an "Available Movies" button.

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar contains links to different sections of the app:

- **Home**: Takes you to the home page.
- **Movies**: Takes you to the movies page where you can view and purchase movie tickets.
- **About Us**: Provides information about FLATDANGO.
- **Contact Us**: Allows you to contact FLATDANGO for any queries or feedback.

### Movie List

The movie list section is initially empty. When you click the "Available Movies" button, the app fetches movie data from the local server and populates the movie list dynamically. Each movie is displayed as a separate card, showing the movie title, poster image, showtime, runtime, and the number of available tickets.

### Buying Tickets

For each movie displayed in the movie list, there is a "Buy Ticket" button. Clicking this button allows you to purchase a ticket for the respective movie. The number of available tickets will be reduced by one, and the updated ticket count will be displayed.
